# 0x06. Regular Expression

## Description

Regular expressions (regex) are powerful tools for pattern matching and text manipulation. In this project, you will dive into the world of regular expressions, using the Oniguruma library, which is used by default in Ruby.

## Concepts

This project focuses on the following concept:

- Regular Expression

## Background Context

The project involves building regular expressions using the Oniguruma library, which is the default regex library used in Ruby. You will work on various tasks to match specific patterns and strings.

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- All files should end with a new line
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the project folder, is mandatory
- All Bash script files must be executable
- The first line of all Bash scripts should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
- All regular expressions must be built for the Oniguruma library
